## CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED

1. **Agent Ecosystem Not Fully Functional**
   - Agents register but don't perform actual tasks
   - Communication system is placeholder
   - Knowledge base integration incomplete

2. **Student Learning Features Missing**
   - No actual learning content
   - Progress tracking is cosmetic
   - Adaptive features not implemented

3. **Admin Controls Non-Functional**
   - Monitoring features are display-only
   - No actual student oversight
   - System controls don't affect anything

4. **Database Integration Issues**
   - Table name mismatches
   - Data type conflicts
   - Query failures

5. **Error Handling Inadequate**
   - No graceful degradation
   - Poor user feedback
   - Console errors not handled

## RECOMMENDATIONS

### Immediate Fixes Needed
1. Fix database schema mismatches
2. Implement proper error boundaries
3. Add loading states and user feedback
4. Complete agent communication system
5. Add actual learning content framework

### Medium Priority
