## üåü Overview

Welcome to **AgentricAI University**‚Äîthe culmination of years of principled engineering, resilient scripting, and emotionally intelligent design. This repository is more than code. It‚Äôs a living framework for agentic learning environments, built to empower diverse learners through adaptive, autonomous, and intuitive AI systems.

Crafted by [Brandon A. Myers](mailto:agentricaiuiux@gmail.com), founder of AgentricAI, this project represents a deeply personal mission: to create the technology his children‚Äîand all children‚Äîdeserve. A space where curiosity is honored, intelligence is nurtured, and every interaction is designed to uplift.
